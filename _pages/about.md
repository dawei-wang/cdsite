This site is maintained by Jez Humble. You can hire me to give [workshops](/about/workshops) or [talks](/about/talks) on a variety of topics including continuous delivery, product management, organizational culture, software engineering, and the lean/agile paradigm.

The source code for this site is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/jezhumble/cdsite). If you have suggestions on how to improve it, please [create an issue](https://github.com/jezhumble/cdsite/issues). This website is based on Jekyll, and the template is modified from the [18F template](https://pages.18f.gov/guides-template/). You can find copyright and license information in the footer at the bottom of this page.

If you're interested in discussing more about continuous delivery, there's an umoderated [continuous delivery mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/continuousdelivery) on Google Groups.

Dave Farley is co-author of the original continuous delivery book. He has a [blog](http://www.davefarley.net/) and a company, [Continuous Delivery Ltd](http://www.continuous-delivery.co.uk/), that does consulting based out of the UK.

### Disclosures ###

I work at the University of California, Berkeley. This site is not maintained as part of my official work duties, and is not endorsed by UC Berkeley. I also derive income from [DevOps Research and Assessment, LLC](http://devops-research.com/), which I co-founded, as well as from royalties from my books and related content. If you buy my stuff via the links on this site, I get a cut from the vendor, whether Amazon or InformIT. I hold some stock options in Chef Software as a result of my previous employment there. Apart from that, my investments are all in wide-ranging mutual funds.

### A note on contacting me ###

The best way to reach me is by email at humble@acm.org, but unfortunately due to the large amount of email I receive I can't guarantee a timely response. I allocate a fixed amount of time to dealing with email, with the result that my backlog is long and growing. I apologize in advance.
