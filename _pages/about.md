Jez Humble is co-author of <a href="https://bit.ly/accelerate-jez">Accelerate</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1942788002?tag=contindelive-20">The DevOps Handbook</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449368425?tag=contindelive-20">Lean Enterprise</a>, and the Jolt Award winning <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321601912?tag=contindelive-20">Continuous Delivery</a>.

### Disclosures ###

I work at the University of California, Berkeley. This site is not maintained as part of my official work duties, and is not endorsed by UC Berkeley. I also derive income from [DevOps Research and Assessment, LLC](http://devops-research.com/), which I co-founded, as well as from royalties from my books and related content. If you buy my stuff via the links on this site, I get a cut from the vendor, whether Amazon or InformIT. All my investments are in wide-ranging mutual funds.

### A note on contacting me ###

The best way to reach me is by email at humble@acm.org, but unfortunately due to the large amount of email I receive I'm afraid I can't guarantee a response. To increase your chances of a response try a query is short and has a simple yes/no answer. In particular, I have learned from experience not to offer advice over the internet. If you're not sure how to proceed, I have two pieces of general advice: first, work from [first principles](https://continuousdelivery.com/principles/). Second, apply the scientific method: Mike Rother's [Improvement Kata](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mrother/Homepage.html) is an excellent resource.
